# Changelog

## 0.3.7
- Pickup tracking (Ryan, Nov 1 2026): when a find leaves the pot, the Watcher GETs its pairing page (read only) and records who now holds the FO/RO seat that was open, plus the CA. A seat that still shows Open on the pairing page while the trip is not in the open time pot is stored as status `open` (suspected hidden by scheduling; the dashboard row turns light red) and rechecked every 20 min for 2 h, then hourly until it is filled or the trip starts. Gone finds from before 0.3.7 are back-filled once.
- The pairing detail now records which seats were open (`open_seats`). Finds carry `prem` (FLICA's Prem column X), `captain` and `picked_by`.

## 0.3.6
- Every pot row and alert carries `turn` (where the trip lands away from HNL, e.g. PPG, or PPG/PPT for several stops) and `route` (HNL-PPG-HNL), read from the pairing detail page already being fetched. The dashboard and push show a no-layover turn as **PPG** instead of "none" (Ryan, Nov 1 2026).

## 0.3.5
- Fixes the false "pot table layout changed" parks (9 on Nov 1, 2026, about 4.5 h blind). Root cause: FLICA never closes a pairing's <tr>, so every later row nests inside the first and the column count in the hash grew with the pot. The hash now counts only the row's own cells. Stored hashes are cleared once (fingerprint v2).
- Self re-arm: if the hash still changes but every pot row still parses (pairing, start date, credit), the new layout is accepted and logged instead of parking. Only a page that no longer parses parks.
- Fit is "No sched" instead of blank when no schedule month covers the dates, so blank never reads as fits.
- The "starting" note clears after the first good check.
- HA side (not in this repo): stale push now waits 30 min or 2.5x the normal interval and goes to both phones with a Re-arm button; the clock card shows BLIND in red past that limit.

## 0.3.4
- Slider ranges per Ryan: hunt 5-90 s (was 15-300), normal 1-20 min (was 1-60). Stored values outside the new range are clamped. Each wait is still randomized +-30 % around the setting.

## 0.3.3
- Every pot row now carries captain, check-in (report), block, TAFB, soft time and fit, not only new-pairing alerts. Detail pages are read once per pairing (cached until it leaves the pot), at most 8 per check, 1.5-3.5 s apart. Fit is re-tagged every check. (Claude, owner from 0.3.3; see FLICA_Watcher_Shared_Context.md.)

## 0.3.2
- Days off computed from the schedule when the page shows no totals (VAC counts as off, as FLICA does). Rest flag only next to a real pairing, not vacation.

## 0.3.1
- Schedule page: try the bid-period BCIDs (001-004 + Priority=1, then the read-only OTDrop view) and remember the one that works.

## 0.3.0
- Reads Ryan's own month schedule (mobileschedule.cgi, GET only) every 30 min into sensor.flica_watcher_schedule; fires flica_watcher/event/schedule_changed when trips change.
- Every new pot/tradeboard alert carries fit: Fits, Conflict <trip>, Check rest <trip>, or Days off <n> (12/13 rule, 10.G).

## 0.2.9
- Pot layout guard no longer trips when the first pot pairing changes (wrapper rows and rows naming a pairing are skipped when hashing the header). It parked the watcher 4 times on Nov 1, 2026.

## 0.2.8
- Tradeboard rows are read from the page's JS data (r[i]=new A(...)); Drop and Trade/Drop posts (the ones with a Pickup Trip button) alert.

## 0.2.6
- Tradeboard: never baseline a page with no trip rows (logs its raw HTML once to find where rows load).

## 0.2.5
- Tradeboard watch (read only): every check (at most every 2 min) reads Tradeboard All Requests for each watched bid month; a new post whose response method is "Pickup Trip" is published on `flica_watcher/event/new_pairing` with `source: tradeboard` (days, depart, arrive, blk, credit=TPay, soft, poster, captain from the detail page). First read is a silent baseline. Failures never stop the pot watch.

## 0.2.4
- Fix: mobile pot Crd/Dy column is pay (credit); the two times are first departure and last arrival, not block and credit (confirmed against the H3619 detail page). Block, check-in, TAFB and captain come from the detail page; `soft` = pay minus block. Rules fall back to first departure for report windows when check-in is unknown.

## 0.2.3
- New pairing pushes carry `captain`, `soft` (credit minus block) and `detail_url`, read with one GET of the pairing's mobile detail page (read only). Logs one detail page's text per start so the captain parser can be checked.

## 0.2.2
- `button.flica_watcher_check_now`: runs a pot check right away (ignored within 10 s of the last check, and while paused or stopped).
- Frequency sliders `number.flica_watcher_normal_minutes` (1-60 min) and `number.flica_watcher_hunt_seconds` (15-300 s); each gap is randomized +-30 % around the setting. Defaults keep the old midpoints (6 min, 40 s).

## 0.2.1
- New `sensor.flica_watcher_next_check` (timestamp): when the next pot check is due; unknown while paused or stopped.
- Read-only page capture every 6 h to /share/flica_watcher/captures (pot page, its links, one pairing detail, any schedule link) so soft time, captain, fits and FAR parsers (t1222) are built from real HTML.

## 0.2.0
- Rules engine (rules.json, Ingress editor page, per-rule live switch with dry-run week gate, cap per day). Read only: no FLICA writes exist.
- Finds history in SQLite; retained `flica_watcher/finds`; new sensors finds, rules_active, last_match.
- State moved from state.json to SQLite (imported once, file renamed `.imported`).
- Pot header fingerprint parks on a table layout change.
- Exponential re-login backoff (1-30 min) replaces the "lost within 15 min" park.
- Next bid month watched once its mobile pot link appears.
- pot_count gets state_class measurement; device shows sw_version; state sensor carries a `note` attribute.
- Fix: mobile pot columns were read in desktop order, so pushes showed the layover as report and the days as layover.
