# Changelog

## 0.2.9
- Pot layout guard no longer trips when the first pot pairing changes (wrapper rows and rows naming a pairing are skipped when hashing the header). It parked the watcher 4 times on Nov 1, 2026.

## 0.2.8
- Tradeboard rows are read from the page's JS data (r[i]=new A(...)); Drop and Trade/Drop posts (the ones with a Pickup Trip button) alert.

## 0.2.6
- Tradeboard: never baseline a page with no trip rows (logs its raw HTML once to find where rows load).

## 0.2.5
- Tradeboard watch (read only): every check (at most every 2 min) reads Tradeboard All Requests for each watched bid month; a new post whose response method is "Pickup Trip" is published on `flica_watcher/event/new_pairing` with `source: tradeboard` (days, depart, arrive, blk, credit=TPay, soft, poster, captain from the detail page). First read is a silent baseline. Failures never stop the pot watch.

## 0.2.4
- Fix: mobile pot Crd/Dy column is pay (credit); the two times are first departure and last arrival, not block and credit (confirmed against the H3619 detail page). Block, check-in, TAFB and captain come from the detail page; `soft` = pay minus block. Rules fall back to first departure for report windows when check-in is unknown.

## 0.2.3
- New pairing pushes carry `captain`, `soft` (credit minus block) and `detail_url`, read with one GET of the pairing's mobile detail page (read only). Logs one detail page's text per start so the captain parser can be checked.

## 0.2.2
- `button.flica_watcher_check_now`: runs a pot check right away (ignored within 10 s of the last check, and while paused or stopped).
- Frequency sliders `number.flica_watcher_normal_minutes` (1-60 min) and `number.flica_watcher_hunt_seconds` (15-300 s); each gap is randomized +-30 % around the setting. Defaults keep the old midpoints (6 min, 40 s).

## 0.2.1
- New `sensor.flica_watcher_next_check` (timestamp): when the next pot check is due; unknown while paused or stopped.
- Read-only page capture every 6 h to /share/flica_watcher/captures (pot page, its links, one pairing detail, any schedule link) so soft time, captain, fits and FAR parsers (t1222) are built from real HTML.

## 0.2.0
- Rules engine (rules.json, Ingress editor page, per-rule live switch with dry-run week gate, cap per day). Read only: no FLICA writes exist.
- Finds history in SQLite; retained `flica_watcher/finds`; new sensors finds, rules_active, last_match.
- State moved from state.json to SQLite (imported once, file renamed `.imported`).
- Pot header fingerprint parks on a table layout change.
- Exponential re-login backoff (1-30 min) replaces the "lost within 15 min" park.
- Next bid month watched once its mobile pot link appears.
- pot_count gets state_class measurement; device shows sw_version; state sensor carries a `note` attribute.
- Fix: mobile pot columns were read in desktop order, so pushes showed the layover as report and the days as layover.
