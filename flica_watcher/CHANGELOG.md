# Changelog

## 0.2.1
- New `sensor.flica_watcher_next_check` (timestamp): when the next pot check is due; unknown while paused or stopped.
- Read-only page capture every 6 h to /share/flica_watcher/captures (pot page, its links, one pairing detail, any schedule link) so soft time, captain, fits and FAR parsers (t1222) are built from real HTML.

## 0.2.0
- Rules engine (rules.json, Ingress editor page, per-rule live switch with dry-run week gate, cap per day). Read only: no FLICA writes exist.
- Finds history in SQLite; retained `flica_watcher/finds`; new sensors finds, rules_active, last_match.
- State moved from state.json to SQLite (imported once, file renamed `.imported`).
- Pot header fingerprint parks on a table layout change.
- Exponential re-login backoff (1-30 min) replaces the "lost within 15 min" park.
- Next bid month watched once its mobile pot link appears.
- pot_count gets state_class measurement; device shows sw_version; state sensor carries a `note` attribute.
- Fix: mobile pot columns were read in desktop order, so pushes showed the layover as report and the days as layover.
